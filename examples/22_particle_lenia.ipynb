    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns and behaviors you see in the video above were produced by the artificial life system that we called “Particle Lenia”. It’s inspired by [Lenia Mathematical Lifeforms](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html), which in turn is a continuous generalization of John Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). In this article we are going to describe the motivation, implementation and behavior of Particle Lenia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the details of the proposed model, we would like to speculate a little about why to create such models. Physics, chemistry and biology study the organization of matter at various scales, from subatomic to cosmic. The behavior of each scale is determined by the laws that govern behavior of the underlying scale, but the nature of relations between scales is full of surprises. For example let’s consider a simple idea: matter consists of tiny, constantly moving particles, which attract each other at close distances, but repel when they are too close. [Lennard-Jones potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential) is one of possible mathematical formalizations of the above idea. In spite of the apparent simplicity of microscopic dynamics, at large scales these rules give rise to a plethora of complex phenomena, such as aggregate states of matter, thermodynamics, acoustics, hydrodynamics and turbulence. In scientific and engineering practice we can often abstract microscopic details behind macroscopic models, such as diffusion or Navier-Stokes equations, that operate at the scale of interest. But in some domains, like material science or biochemistry, we have to focus on the relationship between many orders of magnitude in scale. How do changes in molecular structure reflect in macroscopic material properties? How do genomic sequences translate into morphological appearance? In the field of biology these ties between scales are especially important and obscure at the same time. That’s why development of practical methods of capturing and analyzing such relations are of a great need. *In silico* multi-agent models provide a computational playground for creation and improvement of such methods. We may use such models for efficient design of local microscopic rules that lead to a desired global behavior. Thus, creation of simulated Artificial Life serves as a stepping stone in deep understanding of life in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) cellular automata captivated the attention of a few generations of researchers and hobbyists with a diversity of complex behaviors stemming from a very simple set of local rules. A few continuous generalizations were proposed, [SmoothLife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wDSQxmAyTw) and [Lenia](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html) are most popular among them. They describe evolution of one or a few scalar fields with a system of PDEs. Such models can support a great diversity of interesting and beautiful life-like behaviors. Yet we argue that PDE-based models have a couple of drawbacks, which motivated the creation of the particle based analogy."

Particle Lenia can be seen as another perspective on the Flow Lenia model: we represent moving matter as a population of particles, rather than a scalar field (see [Lagrangian flow vs. Eulerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field)).\n"

We think that the main contribution of this work is to provide a link between the popular Lenia model and particle systems. The proposed artificial life model demonstrates a large diversity of interesting and even beautiful behaviors, even in the case when all particles share the same parameters. We also examine the model dynamics through the lens of a greedy local energy minimization process, and compare the behavior of the model to that of running with an equivalent global energy minimization routine. We find that the difference in behavior between these paradigms is non-intuitive and may have significance for the design of future systems of optimized interacting agents.\n"

It was shown that Lenia creatures can exist on regular and even non-regular grids of various resolutions.

It's easy to see that this transformation doesn't change the values of $\\mathbf{U}$ (and thus $\\mathbf{G}=G(\\mathbf{U})$) perceived by particles, but they are distributed much sparser now, so repulsion forces have weakened or vanished.\n",

    "This video highlights another aspect of Particle Lenia. Particles are initially uniformly scattered in space. Then a cluster with organized structure starts to grow. The shape and behavior of this cluster dramatically changes as it absorbs more particles. Eventually particles assemble into a mushroom-shaped glider that slowly drifts away. It seems that this shape is an attractor for a given set of Lenia parameters and number of points, as running simulation with different initial conditions produces the similar gliders, flying in different directions."

    "### Giving particles voice\n",
    "\n",
    "While working on this article we experimented with various ways of visualizing particles and fields surrounding them. We also thought that it might be interesting to create a kind of audio representation of the particle system state. The process of turning data into sounds is often called [sonification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonification). We tried a simple method when every particle is given a voice, which has a frequency depending on the particle potential energy and volume is proportional to the particle current speed. The video below shows an example sonification of the simulation from the beginning of this article."

    "The text above contains a number of references to other works, which we would like to summarize and categorize in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lenia and Flow Lenia** Particle Lenia was directly inspired by Flow Lenia ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07906), [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14nw3aK5aOMH_brKYdRsXHKt0OgK1RteK?usp=sharing), [videos](https://sites.google.com/view/flowlenia/)) and is designed with the same goals in mind (mass conservation and multiple species in the same world). Our model description closely follows terminology and notation used in original Lenia paper ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05433), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE46jKYcI4Y)). We would also like to mention the Lenia Expanded Universe ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03742), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT49wpyux-k)) and [Sensorimotor Lenia](https://developmentalsystems.org/sensorimotor-lenia/) articles, because they provide a clear path for future development of our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Energy-based models** The energy-based formulation of Particle Lenia is inspired by a number of classic models from physics and chemistry. [Lennard Jones potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential) is a classic example of a system that combines attractive and repulsive potential fields. Energy terms of the [Embedded Atom Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_atom_model) have even greater similarity to the Particle Lenia energy. The biggest difference of our model is the lack of momentum; the assumption that particles are effectively moving through a viscous substance that quickly dissipates kinetic energy. We also think it is worth mentioning [JAX MD](https://github.com/jax-md/jax-md) that implements a number of molecular models using JAX differentiable programing framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Particle-based artificial life** Artificial Life literature is full of examples of simple muliagent models that have sophisticated behaviors. This phenomena is often refered to as [emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence), [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization) or [swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence). [Boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) model of flocking is a classic example from that category. There are plenty other interesting examples, such as [Primordial Particle Systems](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37969) and [models](https://www.ventrella.com/Clusters) [based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kx4Y9TVMGg) based on non-reciprocal forces between different particle types. Other models try to mimic  pheromone signaling through the environment (e.g. [Physarum](https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum) model).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-agent optimization** Particle Lenia model can be interpreted as a collective of agents that try to minimize their individual objective functions. This gives rise to behaviors that have dramatically different characteristics from global energy minimization. Recent work on [EigenGame](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/game-theory-as-an-engine-for-large-scale-data-analysis) provides an interesting example when local multi-agent optimization has a number of desirable traits in comparison to global optimization. These traits enable new ways of solving classic computational problems."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we described Particle Lenia, a new particle system ODE-based artificial life model that is inspired by the Lenia PDE system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive demo and collecting creatures.** The introduction video shows a few creatures and behaviors we found by varying Particle Lenia parameters. These creatures were discovered using the interactive [browser-based demo](https://znah.net/lenia). We invite readers to participate in finding new creatures and sharing them on social media. Preview images created by the demo contain all information needed to bring them into life again, simply drag and drop the image file into the demo window!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future work** The obvious bit that is missing from this article are multi-creature/multi-particle types experiments. Although the model simulation code can be trivially extended to support per-particle parameters, we decided to leave this exploration for the future. Another promising future work direction is goal driven search for patterns and rules capable of forming specific patterns or performing specific tasks, in the spirit of [Sensorimotor Lenia](https://developmentalsystems.org/sensorimotor-lenia/). We believe that these principles of particle swarm design can later be applied to real world self-organizing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reproducibility** All experiments and diagrams in this article were produced using this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/self-organising-systems/blob/master/notebooks/particle_lenia.ipynb). The [introduction video](https://youtu.be/AP3zeHyWakw) demonstrates a number of creatures that were discovered, and can be explored in the supplementary [interactive demo](https://znah.net/lenia)\n",
